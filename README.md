Inputs: ".slp" File
Outputs: Pretty graphs

Design a Matlab program which takes a ".slp" file as input and analyzes the data appropriately. Most likely this will take the form of a Motion vs. Time graph, where motion is somehow calculated from the X, Y, and Z values.

This program is for internal use only. It will allow us to view trends in sleep patterns in order to draw conclusions on the sleep-status of tracked patients.
